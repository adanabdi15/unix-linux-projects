My letter
Hi there, I hope this day finds you well. 
Unfortunately we were not able to make it to your dining 
room this year while vacationing in Algonquin Park - I
especially wished to see the model of the Highland Inn
and the train station in the dining room. 
I have been reading on the history of Algonquin Park but 
no where could I find a description of where the Highland 
Inn was originally located on cache lake. 
if it is no trouble, could you kindly let me know such that 
i need not wait until next year when i visit you lodge ?
regards, 
Mackenzie Elizabeth 
P.S How were the flies and bears this year ?
